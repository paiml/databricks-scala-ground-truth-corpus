# Introduction

This corpus provides production-ready Scala patterns for Apache Spark on Databricks, covering four key domains:

1. **Spark Fundamentals** — DataFrame operations, SQL, UDFs, window functions, join strategies
2. **ML/MLflow** — Feature engineering, pipeline construction, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning
3. **Delta Lake** — Table operations, CDC, schema evolution, time travel
4. **Structured Streaming** — Stream processing, windowed aggregation, stream-stream/static joins

Each module follows Popperian falsification methodology with 95%+ test coverage enforced by sbt-scoverage.
